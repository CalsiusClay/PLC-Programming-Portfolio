## 🧠 Project Type

This is a **simulation-only project** built using **CODESYS V3.5**, designed to emulate a real-world bin tipping automation system. No physical hardware is required to run or test the logic.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **CODESYS V3.5 SPxx** (Structured Text programming)
- **CODESYS SoftPLC** for simulation
- **Built-in Visualizations** (for sensor/motor status)

> ⚠️ **NOTE:** This project is a simulated environment for learning and portfolio purposes. No real PLC hardware is required.

> In simulation, I/O signals (`Sensor_1`, `Limit_Fwd`, etc.) are controlled via visualization or manually toggled booleans in the CODESYS IDE.
