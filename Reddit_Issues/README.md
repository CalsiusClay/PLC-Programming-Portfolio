# 🔧 Reddit Issues Solved – PLC & Automation Fixes

Welcome to the **Reddit Issues Solved** folder—a living archive of real-world problems sourced from Reddit (especially [r/PLC](https://www.reddit.com/r/PLC), [r/automation](https://www.reddit.com/r/automation), and [r/Codesys](https://www.reddit.com/r/Codesys)) that I’ve analyzed and resolved using Structured Text, ladder logic, or CODESYS simulation.

This folder serves as:
- A **showcase of my technical troubleshooting process**
- A **learning resource** for others struggling with the same problems
- A **contribution back to the community** that helped me grow
