# 🏗️ Bin Tipper Automation – CODESYS | Structured Text Demo

This is a modular demo project simulating a fully automated bin handling and tipping system, built using Structured Text (IEC 61131-3) in CODESYS V3.5.

Originally conceived as a quick Reddit solution for a conveyor-sequencing question, it quickly revealed the hidden complexity of "simple" automation systems. This project has since evolved into a learning lab, a portfolio piece, and a step-by-step showcase of real-world PLC logic design.

## 🔧 Project Purpose

To demonstrate:

- ✅ Structured Text logic  
- ✅ Modular development with Function Blocks and STRUCTs  
- ✅ Conveyor sequencing and bin flow control  
- ✅ Timer-based delay coordination (TON/TOF)  
- 🔁 Potential for PID integration (bin spacing control)  
- 🧱 Scalable architecture for real-world automation systems

## 🧠 Origin Story

> "It started as a Reddit reply... I just wanted to help someone with 3 conveyors and a stepper motor.  
> But the moment I dug in, I realized: this isn’t just about moving bins—it’s about thinking modular, timing logic, and anticipating real-world problems."

— **Nathanael K. Binu** (aka *Kermitsmittle*)

## 🧱 System Overview

**Hardware Simulated:**

- 3 Conveyor Belts (`Conveyor_1`, `Conveyor_2`, `Conveyor_3`)  
- 3 Sensors (one per conveyor)  
- 1 Stepper Motor for the bin tipper  
- **PLC**: CODESYS Control Win (PC-based simulation)  

**System Functionality:**

- Bins travel via conveyors in sequence  
- Sensors detect bin presence  
- Time delays ensure spacing between bins  
- Stepper motor triggers tipper when bin reaches final position  
- (Optional) PID logic to maintain spacing between bins based on sensor feedback *(upcoming module)*
