# 🧪 Demo Projects – Work in Progress

Welcome to my sandbox of **automation demo projects**, built with **Structured Text (IEC 61131-3)** in **CODESYS V3.5**.

These are modular, simulation-ready systems that focus on **real-world automation logic** using:

- Function Blocks & STRUCTs  
- Sequencing logic  
- Timers, counters, and interlocks  
- Visualization (where applicable)

> Every demo here started as a small idea—but scaled into a showcase of how "simple" automation problems are rarely simple in practice.

## 🧱 Demo Index

### 1. 🏗️ Bin Tipper Automation (`/conveyor-bin-tipper`)
A fully simulated bin handling and tipping system using 3 conveyors, sensors, and a stepper motor. Originally sparked by a Reddit thread, this became my first official demo system—and a deep dive into modular conveyor logic.

🔧 Highlights:
- Conveyor sequencing with delays  
- Sensor-triggered logic  
- Stepper motor control using pulse/direction  
- Clean modular architecture using FBs and STRUCTs  
- Ideal for beginners exploring ST in real systems

📦 Includes:
- CODESYS project files  
- Simulation setup  
- Code breakdown + commentary

### 2. 🏥 HVAC Surgery Room Automation (`/hvac-surgery-room`)
A large-scale, exam-level simulation of a hospital HVAC system designed to manage airflow, pressure, and environment across multiple surgery rooms.

🔧 Highlights:
- PID loops for temperature & pressure control  
- Multi-zone sensor input mapping  
- Safety interlocks & alarm logic  
- Expandable control strategy  
- Real-world relevance for critical environments

📦 Includes (soon):
- Full PLC architecture  
- I/O simulation map  
- Commentary on system design & logic
