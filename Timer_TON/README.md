# Timer_TON – Blinking Light with Structured Text (CODESYS)

🛠️ This project demonstrates:
- Using a TON timer in ST
- Turning a lamp on/off with a blinking effect
- Triggered only when a switch is ON

🔧 Tech used:
- CODESYS V3
- ST (Structured Text)
- Basic Visualization

🚦How it works:
When the `switch` is turned ON, the light (`light`) blinks every 1 second using a TON timer and NOT logic.
