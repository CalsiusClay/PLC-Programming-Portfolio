# üèóÔ∏è Bin Tipper Automation ‚Äì Simulated in CODESYS | Structured Text

This project implements a **fully automated bin tipping system** using **Structured Text (IEC 61131-3)** and simulated entirely in **CODESYS V3.5**. It recreates the behavior of an industrial bin handling line featuring 3 conveyors, a tipper, sensors, limit switches, and a bin counter.

The logic is written in Structured Text and tested using **CODESYS SoftPLC**, making it a safe, clean, and hardware-free way to learn and showcase PLC automation.

## üöÄ System Overview

**Goal:** Automate bin transport and tipping through a chain of conveyors and tipper motor control in a simulated environment.

### üß© Components:
- **3 Conveyors**: 
  - Conveyor 1 (Infeed)  
  - Conveyor 2 (Post-tip feeder)  
  - Conveyor 3 (Outfeed/ejection)  
- **1 Tipper**:
  - Controlled by forward & reverse outputs
- **6 Sensors**: 
  - Detect bin presence & tipper positions
- **2 Limit Switches**:
  - Detect forward and home tipper positions
- **1 Timer**:
  - Waits 4 seconds for tipping stability
- **1 Counter**:
  - Tracks how many bins are processed

## üîÅ Sequence Logic

1. **Bin enters Conveyor 1** ‚Üí Detected by Sensor 1 ‚Üí Start Conveyor 1 & increment bin counter
2. **Bin passes Sensor 2** ‚Üí Start tipper conveyor
3. **Bin reaches Sensor 4** ‚Üí Stop Conveyor 1 & Tipper Conveyor
4. **Tipper forward movement** until it hits Limit Switch 1
5. **Wait 4 seconds** at forward position
6. **Reverse tipper** until home position (Limit Switch 2)
7. **Start Conveyor 2** ‚Üí Then Conveyor 3 when Sensor 5 is triggered
8. **When Sensor 6 is active**, stop Conveyor 3 and decrement bin counter
9. **Repeat cycle** if bins remain

## üîß I/O Simulation Map

In CODESYS, all inputs are simulated using BOOL variables or visualization buttons. Outputs are also monitored through BOOL flags or visualization indicators.

### ‚û°Ô∏è Simulated Inputs
| Name        | Type | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| `Sensor_1`  | BOOL | Bin enters |
| `Sensor_2`  | BOOL | Before tipper |
| `Sensor_3`  | BOOL | In tipper |
| `Sensor_4`  | BOOL | Tip-ready |
| `Limit_FWD` | BOOL | Tipper fully tipped |
| `Limit_REV` | BOOL | Tipper returned |
| `Sensor_5`  | BOOL | Bin on Conveyor 2 |
| `Sensor_6`  | BOOL | Bin exited |

### ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Simulated Outputs
|     Name         | Type | Description |
|------------------|------|-------------|
|    `Conveyor1`   | BOOL | Conveyor 1 |
| `TipperConveyor` | BOOL | Moves bin into tipper |
|    `TipperFwd`   | BOOL | Tipper forward |
|    `TipperRev`   | BOOL | Tipper reverse |
|    `Conveyor2`   | BOOL | Conveyor 2 |
|    `Conveyor3`   | BOOL | Conveyor 3 |
